RequiEn - Requirements Engine v0.1

The requirements engine aims to do all requirements related "grunt work" automatically. These tasks may take a human weeks to complete. ReqiEn will be able to
parse through thousands of requirements and modify, move, or otherwise change them in minutes. RequiEn will be based on a Large Language Model (LLM) that will
be capable of contextually altering and set of requirements. This will drastically efficientize the requirements process and save both time and money for the
program it is used for.

Core Functionality:
- Parse through an excel file containing requirements
- Add/remove terms from each requirement
- Remove entire swaths of redundant/outdated requirements
- Match requirements based on context from different DOORS documents
- Flag requirements based on some criteria
- Understand (to some degree) the context in which these requirements exist
- Have a GUI for ease of use
- Be simple enough for persistent use in the future
- Be capable for operating on an internet-limited, closed space desktop
